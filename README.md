# robot-simulation
This repository contains a project developed for controlling a humanoid robot in a 3D environment using the Webots simulator. The project is based on object-oriented programming principles, enabling robot motion control, sensor data acquisition, and path management through a menu-driven interface. The system communicates with the robot using the NaoRobotAPI.
